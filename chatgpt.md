Let's design a BPMN process for a fictional but realistic scenario involving a Tech Startup Company that is developing a new software application, coordinating with an External Testing Company, and interfacing with a Customer Feedback System. This setup will involve intricate processes and message exchanges between the different pools.

## Process Description:

### Main Pool: Tech Startup Company
Objective: Develop and refine a software application through iterative testing and customer feedback.
Key Activities: Development, Internal Testing, Deployment, Update Roll-outs.

### External Pools:

#### External Testing Company
Objective: Perform detailed external testing of the software to identify bugs and usability issues not caught during internal testing.
Interaction: Receive software versions for testing, return test results and bug reports.

#### Customer Feedback System
Objective: Collect feedback from beta testers or early users regarding their experience, usability, and bugs.
Interaction: Provide feedback reports that influence the development process.


## Process Model for the Tech Startup Company:

### Flow Objects:
Start Event - Initiation of the development cycle.
Task - Draft initial software requirements.
Task - Develop the software.
Task - Conduct internal testing.
Exclusive Gateway - Check if internal tests pass.
Task - Send software to External Testing Company.
Receive Task - Receive test results from External Testing Company.
Exclusive Gateway - Decide if external tests are passed.
Task - Deploy for beta testing.
Receive Task - Receive feedback from Customer Feedback System.
Task - Analyze feedback.
Task - Plan updates based on feedback and test results.
Task - Implement updates.
Loop Back to Internal Testing - Iterate development based on feedback.
End Event - Final software version is approved and ready for launch.

### Message Flows:
Messages sent to External Testing Company with software versions.
Test results received from External Testing Company.
Beta version deployments to Customer Feedback System.
Feedback received from customers.

### Exception Handling:
Error Event (attached to the task of deploying for beta testing) - If deployment fails, trigger error handling routine.
Timer Event (intermediate) - If no feedback is received within a specified timeframe, send a reminder or escalate internally.

### Business Objects:
Software Requirements Document
Test Report
Feedback Report
